## Introduction and context
This code was created for a school work. The purpose of this repository is to implement operations on big numbers necessary for cryptographic purposes (i.e. 1024 bits AES, 256 bits RSA...).</br>
Of course, more advanced and probably perfomant library exist for theses operations. But it was really intersting to face the difficulties of coding these operation in C++.

## Operation implemented
The following operations have been implemented : 
  - Modular addition
  - Modular substraction
  - Modular mutliplication
  - Modular exponentiation (using montgomery algorithm)
